# Math Formulas As Code

This whole repo is just going to be math formulas written as code. I started with statistics, hopefully I and the community can expand this to other branches of math.

I don't have a traditional background compared to the average software engineer. In school I always hated learning math and statistics where the formulas were written in normal math notation. For me an equation written in code becomes so easy to read. I also understand it much deeper. Nesting formulas also makes it extremely easy to see how formulas are all tied together.

This repo was inspired by the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindstorms-Children-Computers-Powerful-Ideas/dp/1541675126/ref=asc_df_1541675126/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=509494905560&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5215797345422905451&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9067609&hvtargid=pla-917985559093&psc=1">Mindstorms</a>.
